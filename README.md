# Bowling Kata
This project is a short kata to keep skills with haskell sharp.
The important module in the project is Scoring.hs
All other modules were provided by stack. 

## Run tests
This project was written with TDD style. Thus, the tests cover the use cases quite effectively.
To run the tests, use the command 

$ stack test

## Executing the project
As this is just a kata, I have not given the project any IO or top-level structure. 
This was simply a test to implement bowling scoring in haskell. 
There is no way to execute this project outside of ghci.
